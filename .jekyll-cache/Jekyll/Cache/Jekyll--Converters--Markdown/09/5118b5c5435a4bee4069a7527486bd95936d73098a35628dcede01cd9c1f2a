I"´<p>Levy largely described hackers as essentially â€œno-lifersâ€ who spend their whole life and spirt dedicated to computers and nothing else, not even the simple shower. Through this lifestyle, these hackers lead groundbreaking innovations and create really neat stuff. Generally, these hackers focus more on stretching the limitations of the systems to make art and beauty, and less of the implications. This thematic â€œshunningâ€ of all things not computation is characteristic of the Levy hacker. We discussed in class a large number of these true hackers donâ€™t even do their computing coursework, as even that isnâ€™t important when faced with the prospect of time on a machine.</p>
